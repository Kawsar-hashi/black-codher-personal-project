Welcome to Setle. An app designed by Kawsar Hashi as part of the Black Codher Bootcamp Mentorship programme. This app is designed to showcase my front and backend capabilities where i demonstrate my MERN knowledge. This is my first Full stack app project so its not extremely complicated but is a cool way to showcase my skills. This app is a games and quiz app where users can sign in and play a game and save their progress.
 Thank you for checking this out.
